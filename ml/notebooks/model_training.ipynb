# MindTrace AI – Model Training & Evaluation

## Objective
Train a machine learning model to detect early cognitive stress and burnout risk
using behavioral and cognitive interaction signals.

## Dataset
- Synthetic & anonymized student interaction data
- Features:
  - Response time
  - Error rate
  - Consistency
  - Fatigue index

## Model Selection
Random Forest was chosen due to:
- Robustness on small datasets
- Non-linear pattern detection
- Explainability via feature importance


python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

data = pd.read_csv("../data/sample_dataset.csv")
X = data[["response_time", "error_rate", "consistency", "fatigue_index"]]
y = data["stress_label"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

preds = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score(y_test, preds)
